    <h2>Running with Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Morning Run Club is more than just a group of runners. We're a Christian community that believes in starting the week with movement, discipline, and Scripture. Every Monday morning, we run together—not just for fitness, but to draw strength from God and one another.
    </p>

    <h2>Verse of the Week</h2>
    <p>
      Before each run, we share a Bible verse to remind us that our strength comes from the Lord. These verses guide our mindset and help us run with endurance, joy, and purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
      <li><strong>Faith</strong> – We trust in God's plan and lean on Him for strength.</li>

      <li><strong>Joy</strong> – We find joy in movement, nature, and starting the week right.</li>
